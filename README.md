I am a Peruvian boy who has a very curious mind. I am always willing to know new things every day. I am a **student** currently studying **computer science**

- 🌱  I’m currently learning ***everything*** 🤣*
- 💡 I love the new technologies that emerge every day
- 📚 My notes of learning at [dinhanhthi.com](http://dinhanhthi.com/).
- 😍 My hobbies are [drawing](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9OVEkdTjmtRPg7vC3), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19630622-thi-dinh) and [cooking](https://goo.gl/photos/yQXdQws1LLS16x5v5).
- 🚀 One day I will fulfill my dream of giving happiness to the families who lost their members for unknown reasons using virtual reality to recreate them giving them the peace of mind that they are **well** 😉
